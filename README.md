# Golf-of-Life
A code golf version of Conway's Game of Life made in C++ but will work with a C compiler and a few changes to the headers.
If anyone wants help understanding it, I can make a hint files, but at the moment I no intentions of doing so.
The program can be compiled simply with `g++ life.cpp`
So far I have not been able to find a version of the game of life any smaller than this one (it may be a world record but I doubt that), but I would really like to see it beaten.
